ICO Fundraising Success Prediction:
Predict whether a team or company will successfully reach its fundraising goal through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) using various machine learning models. 

This project uses historical data to analyze the factors that contribute to successful ICO campaigns and employs multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the success likelihood of a given ICO.

Overview-
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a popular way for companies to raise capital, especially in the blockchain and cryptocurrency spaces. However, many ICOs fail to meet their fundraising targets. This project aims to build a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of an ICO's success based on features such as the company's team size, marketing reach, platform indicators, etc.

Features-
Feature Selection: Extract meaningful features to improve model performance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and log-loss.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search and cross-validation to optimize model parameters.
Comparative Analysis: Analyze and compare models to identify the best-performing model for ICO success prediction.

Models used-
Naive Bayes (for categorical data)
Decision Trees (with AdaBoost)
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Results-
Detailed results for each model, including accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and log-loss, are saved in the results part.
